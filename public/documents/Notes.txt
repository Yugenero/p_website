 - Note to self instead of having text that brings you to the home page 
 	try to create a navigation icon that opens up the whole page and displays the 
 	navigation items along with breadcrumbs in the top of the page. Add visuals for 
	the text fade in effects and other shapes such as lines for a more cohesive look
	text should be black and the background whould be white and should drop from the 
	top-down

- Thinking about adding more personality to my portfolio and adding more misc things hobbies,
	extracurriculars, etc. Navigation will help with this and I should be using Router and router context
	in order to direct visitors properly to different pages separate from the main page
